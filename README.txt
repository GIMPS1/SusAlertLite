Compliance & Disclaimer

SusAlert Lite is a visual-only helper tool designed to assist with tracking Croesus mechanics in RuneScape 3.

The application:

- Uses screen capture to visually monitor the in-game Croesus boss timer
- Does not read or access RuneScape game memory
- Does not modify or inject into the RuneScape client
- Does not generate automated inputs or control gameplay

It functions similarly to external timers or visual overlay tools (such as Alt1), providing quality-of-life assistance without interacting with the game itself.

RuneScape’s third-party software rules prohibit tools that communicate directly with game worlds, automate input, or modify the client. Visual-only tools are not explicitly restricted under current guidelines.

Users are responsible for ensuring their own compliance with Jagex’s terms of service and third-party software policies.

SusAlert Lite is provided as-is with no affiliation to or endorsement by Jagex Ltd.
